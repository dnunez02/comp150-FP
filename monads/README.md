Practice writing monads
==========================

1. Randomness - Create a monad that takes a source of randmoness and produces random data
2. Dot Writer Monad - Create a writer to create dot files to visualize graphs w/o letting the
                      user have to deal with the headaches.
3. Use IO/Randomness/Dot Writer
